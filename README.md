# car-price-predictor
 A Machine Learning web app using Decision Tree Regression to estimate car resale value based on user inputs like mileage, fuel type, and transmission. Built with Streamlit.
 # ðŸš— Car Price Predictor

This project is a simple yet effective **Machine Learning web application** that predicts the selling price of a used car based on input features such as:

- KMs Driven
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type

## ðŸ›  Built With
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## ðŸ“¦ Model Used
- Decision Tree Regressor

## ðŸ”® How It Works
The model was trained on a dataset from CarDekho and saved as a `.pkl` file. The frontend uses Streamlit to take user inputs and display the predicted price in real-time.
